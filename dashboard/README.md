# Dashboard

This is the project that contains source code of the dashboard app.

To run it, you will need to set up several things:

First, copy over `.env.example` from root folder to this one. Rename it to `.env`.

Then, from project root folder, run:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace=dashboard
```

To run in production mode (the only difference is no watch mode), just change the script from `dev` to `start`.

# Usage

To login, just use `admin` and `password` as username and password.
